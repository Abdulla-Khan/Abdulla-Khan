# Hi there! 👋 I'm Abdullah Khan

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a **Flutter Developer** with over two years of experience, currently working at a startup. I have a strong interest in **Database Systems**, **Programming**, **Algorithms**, and **Data Structures**. I recently completed my **Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering** and am considering pursuing a **Master's degree** to further deepen my knowledge.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Developing an LMS using **React**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, and **Firebase**. This project involves creating a seamless and user-friendly dashboard with robust features.
- **AR Application**: Building an augmented reality application that visualizes data structures using **Unity** and **Flutter**. Firebase is used for backend services, and the UI is crafted in Flutter, with the AR experience powered by Unity.
- **Webview Translation**: Implementing a multilingual webview in Flutter using the `in_app_webview` package. The goal is to provide a user-friendly translation feature similar to Chrome's translate popup.

### 🌱 Always Learning
I believe in continuous learning and always strive to improve my skills. I'm currently diving deeper into advanced Flutter techniques and exploring more complex algorithms and data structures.
